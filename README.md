# Aochi2018

This repertory provides the programs calculating the depth-dependent stress accumulation on faults for earthquake simulations.

The formulations are based on the following papers. 

1. Aochi, H., Dynamic asymmetry of normal and reverse faults due to constrained depth-dependent stress accumulation, Geophys. J. Int., 215, 2134-3243, doi:10.1093/ggy407, 2018.
